chat history (maybe?)
emotes in message view
chat resizer on android
test to make sure whispers are showing in chat correctly
work with ceneza on notifications

potential launch issues: 
    - subscriptions may not work
    - donations may not work
    - twitch view renderer error on old android platforms -- maybe a native component is needed on android
    - twitch view may have obnoxious content warning every time -- maybe inject some js to bypass

launch bugs:

IllegalViewOperationExceptionMainActivity, thinking this is the emote drawer being
optimized away, and thinking that I have fixed it...
