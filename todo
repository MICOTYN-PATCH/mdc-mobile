chat history (maybe?)
emotes in message view
work with ceneza on notifications

potential launch issues: 
    - subscriptions may not work
    - donations may not work
    - twitch view renderer error on old android platforms -- maybe a native component is needed on android
    - twitch view may have obnoxious content warning every time -- maybe inject some js to bypass

launch bugs:

stream/chat toggle

card bacground overlay

button to toggle menu

set maximum chat resize

This makes reading this.state right after calling setState() a potential pitfall. 

only render emotedir when relevant, animate emotedir, keep drawer closed with emotedir open.
