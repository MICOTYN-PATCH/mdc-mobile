chat history (maybe?)
emotes in message view
chat resizer on android
test to make sure whispers are showing in chat correctly
work with ceneza on notifications

potential launch issues: 
    - subscriptions may not work
    - donations may not work
    - twitch view renderer error on old android platforms -- maybe a native component is needed on android
    - twitch view may have obnoxious content warning every time -- maybe inject some js to bypass

launch bugs:

settings menu

remove dragger bar from emote dir.

slightly reduce rounding on drawer corners

animate drawer handle up and down and change opacity slightly
so you can see it when closed.

link modal

horizontal view
